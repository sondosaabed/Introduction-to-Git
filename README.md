# Introduction-to-Git
This course introduces learners to version control using Git. You will discover the importance of version control when working on data science projects and explore how you can use Git to track files, compare differences, modify and save files, undo changes, and allow collaborative development through the use of branches. You will gain an introduction to the structure of a repository, how to create new repositories and clone existing ones, and show how Git stores data. By working through typical data science tasks, you will gain the skills to handle conflicting files.

## Course Material 
- **Chapter 1: Introduction to Git**: In the first chapter, I have learned what version control is and why it is essential for data projects. Then, I have discovered what Git is and how to use it for a version control workflow.
- **Chapter 2: Making changes:** Next, I have examined how Git stores data, learned essential commands to compare files and repositories at different times, and understood the process for restoring earlier versions of files in data projects.
- **Chapter 3: Git workflows** In this chapter, I have learned tips and tricks for configuring Git to be more efficient! I also discovered branches, identified how to create and switch to different branches, compared versions of files between branches, merged branches together, and dealt with conflicting files across branches.
- **Chpater 4: Collaborating with Git:** This final chapter is all about collaboration! I have gained an introduction to remote repositories and learned how to work with them to synchronize content between the cloud and my local computer. I also saw how to create new repositories and clone existing ones, along with discovering a workflow to minimize the risk of conflicts between local and remote repositories.
